## Technical Details

### CI/CD Pipeline Improvements

1. **Main Workflow** (`.github/workflows/python-app.yml`):
   - Matrix testing across Python 3.9-3.12
   - Dependency caching with actions/cache@v4
   - Coverage reporting with pytest-cov
   - Artifact uploading with actions/upload-artifact@v4
   - Build package generation
   - Codecov integration

2. **Security Workflow** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`):
   - Scheduled daily security scans
   - Multiple security tools (Bandit, Safety, Semgrep)
   - Security report artifact generation
   - SARIF upload for GitHub Security tab

### Test Suite

- **Unit Tests**: 13+ test methods for Task model
- **Service Tests**: 20+ test methods for TaskService
- **CLI Tests**: 12+ test methods for command-line interface
- **Integration Tests**: 8+ comprehensive workflow tests
- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum coverage requirement

### Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   pytest --cov=src
   flake8 src/ tests/
   ```

2. **CI Pipeline**:
   - Automatic testing on push/PR
   - Multi-version compatibility testing
   - Security scanning
   - Coverage reporting
   - Build artifact generation

3. **Quality Gates**:
   - All tests must pass
   - 80% minimum code coverage
   - No security vulnerabilities
   - Code style compliance
