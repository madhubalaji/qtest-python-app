## Test Results

| Test Case | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Test Case 1 | Pass | Task was successfully deleted after confirmation |
| Test Case 2 | Pass | Task remained after navigating away without confirming |
| Test Case 3 | Pass | Task was successfully deleted from search results view |

| Test Case 5 | Pass | No crashes when attempting to delete non-existent task |

## Summary

The delete task functionality works as expected in both the "View Tasks" and "Search Tasks" pages. The confirmation mechanism successfully prevents accidental deletions, and the application handles error cases gracefully.
