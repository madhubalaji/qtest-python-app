# Delete Task Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the delete task functionality in the Task Manager UI. The feature allows users to delete tasks from multiple locations within the Streamlit application with proper confirmation dialogs to prevent accidental deletions.

## Changes Made

### 1. View Tasks Page (`display_tasks_page` function)

#### UI Layout Changes
- **Modified column layout**: Changed from 3 columns `[3, 1, 1]` to 4 columns `[3, 1, 1, 1]` to accommodate the delete button
- **Added delete button**: Added a trash can emoji (üóëÔ∏è) button in the fourth column with tooltip "Delete task"

#### Functionality Added
- **Delete button logic**: When clicked, stores task ID and title in session state for confirmation
- **Confirmation dialog**: Added warning dialog with task title and "This action cannot be undone" message
- **Confirmation buttons**: "Yes, Delete" (primary button) and "Cancel" buttons
- **Session state management**: Proper cleanup of session state variables after deletion or cancellation

#### Code Location
```python
# Lines 76-140 in src/app.py
with col4:
    if st.button("üóëÔ∏è", key=f"delete_{task.id}", help="Delete task"):
        st.session_state.task_to_delete = task.id
        st.session_state.task_to_delete_title = task.title
        st.rerun()
```

### 2. Search Tasks Page (`search_tasks_page` function)

#### Search Results List
- **Modified column layout**: Changed from 2 columns `[4, 1]` to 3 columns `[4, 1, 1]`
- **Added delete button**: Added trash can emoji button in search results for quick deletion

#### Task Detail View
- **Modified column layout**: Changed from 2 columns to 3 columns for task details
- **Added delete button**: "Delete Task" button in task detail view
- **Enhanced button layout**: "Mark as Complete", "Delete Task", and "Close" buttons

#### Confirmation Dialog
- **Separate confirmation flow**: Uses `task_to_delete_from_search` session state variables
- **Integrated cleanup**: Automatically closes task detail view when task is deleted
- **Proper error handling**: Handles cases where task might be deleted by another process

#### Code Location
```python
# Lines 186-273 in src/app.py
with col3:
    if st.button("üóëÔ∏è", key=f"delete_search_{task.id}", help="Delete task"):
        st.session_state.task_to_delete_from_search = task.id
        st.session_state.task_to_delete_from_search_title = task.title
        st.rerun()
```

### 3. Error Handling and User Experience

#### Error Handling
- **TaskNotFoundException**: Proper handling when task doesn't exist
- **Session state cleanup**: Ensures no orphaned session state variables
- **Graceful degradation**: User-friendly error messages

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Prevent accidental deletions
- **Success messages**: Confirm successful deletion with task title
- **Visual feedback**: Clear button styling and tooltips
- **Consistent behavior**: Same deletion flow across all pages

### 4. Technical Improvements

#### Streamlit Compatibility
- **Updated rerun calls**: Replaced deprecated `st.experimental_rerun()` with `st.rerun()` for Streamlit >= 1.22.0
- **Session state management**: Proper use of Streamlit session state for UI flow control
- **Button key uniqueness**: Unique keys for all buttons to prevent conflicts

#### Code Quality
- **Consistent naming**: Clear variable names for different deletion contexts
- **Proper cleanup**: Session state variables are always cleaned up
- **Error resilience**: Handles edge cases and concurrent modifications

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes
- **`src/app.py`**: Main implementation of delete functionality in UI

### Supporting Files
- **`test_delete_functionality.py`**: Comprehensive test suite for validation
- **`DELETE_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**: This documentation file

## Backend Integration

The implementation leverages the existing `delete_task` method in `TaskService` class:
```python
def delete_task(self, task_id: int) -> Task:
    """Delete a task and return the deleted task object."""
    task = self.get_task_by_id(task_id)
    self.tasks.remove(task)
    self._save_tasks()
    return task
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the test suite to verify implementation:
```bash
python test_delete_functionality.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Start the application: `streamlit run src/app.py`
2. Create some test tasks
3. Test deletion from View Tasks page
4. Test deletion from Search Tasks page
5. Test deletion from task detail view
6. Verify confirmation dialogs work
7. Test cancellation flow
8. Test error handling (try deleting non-existent tasks)

## User Interface Flow

### Delete from View Tasks Page
1. User clicks trash can (üóëÔ∏è) button next to a task
2. Confirmation dialog appears with task title
3. User clicks "Yes, Delete" or "Cancel"
4. If confirmed, task is deleted and success message shown
5. Page refreshes to show updated task list

### Delete from Search Tasks Page
1. **From search results**: User clicks trash can button in search results
2. **From task details**: User clicks "Delete Task" button in expanded view
3. Same confirmation flow as View Tasks page
4. Task detail view automatically closes if task was being viewed

## Session State Variables

### View Tasks Page
- `st.session_state.task_to_delete`: ID of task to be deleted
- `st.session_state.task_to_delete_title`: Title of task for confirmation dialog

### Search Tasks Page
- `st.session_state.task_to_delete_from_search`: ID of task to be deleted from search
- `st.session_state.task_to_delete_from_search_title`: Title for confirmation dialog
- `st.session_state.task_to_view`: ID of task being viewed in detail (existing)

## Security Considerations

- **Confirmation dialogs**: Prevent accidental deletions
- **No direct deletion**: All deletions require user confirmation
- **Session isolation**: Each user session manages its own deletion state
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of concurrent modifications

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- **Bulk deletion**: Select multiple tasks for deletion
- **Soft delete**: Move tasks to trash before permanent deletion
- **Undo functionality**: Allow users to restore recently deleted tasks
- **Deletion history**: Log of deleted tasks for audit purposes
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Delete key support for selected tasks

## Conclusion

The delete task functionality has been successfully implemented across all relevant pages of the Task Manager application. The implementation includes proper confirmation dialogs, error handling, and session state management to provide a robust and user-friendly experience.
